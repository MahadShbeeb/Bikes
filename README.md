## üèóÔ∏è States for Better UX

This application includes different states to handle various scenarios during the bike theft data fetching and display process:

1. **Loading State**:  
   Displays a loading indicator while the data is being fetched. This is implemented using the `<Backdrop>` and `<CircularProgress>` components from Material-UI.

   ```jsx
   <Backdrop
     sx={(theme) => ({ color: "#fff", zIndex: theme.zIndex.drawer + 1 })}
     open={isLoading}
   >
     <CircularProgress color="inherit" />
   </Backdrop>
   ```

2. **Error State**:  
   Displays an error snackbar indicates an error happening.

   ```jsx
   enqueueSnackbar(
     error.response?.data || error?.message || "Something went wrong",
     {
       variant: "error",
     }
   );
   ```

3. **Empty State**:
   Just show a No available bikes expression

## üìä Technical Challenges

### 1. **API Inconsistencies**

- **Theft Count Response**  
  The API returns a theft count of **9900**, but no results are displayed.

  ![API Theft Count Response](./public/assets/images/search-giant-count.png)

- **Empty Bike Cases List**  
  The response for bike cases is an **empty array**.

### 2. **Filtering and Sorting**

- **Filtering by Partial Case Title**  
  UI and query parameters for filtering are implemented, but the BikeIndex API does not provide a corresponding endpoint to filter results by case title.
- **Filtering by Date Range**  
  Similar to the title filter, UI is implemented, but the API lacks a corresponding endpoint for filtering by date range.
- **Inconsistent API Responses**  
  Example: Searching with the keyword "giant" returns a theft count of 9900, but the actual cases array is empty. This inconsistency impacts the user experience and filtering logic.

  ```

üîÆ Future Improvements
Custom Backend: Implement a backend service to handle filtering by title and date range.
